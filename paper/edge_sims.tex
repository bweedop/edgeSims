\section*{Abstract}

Faced with the challenge of saving as much diversity as possible given financial
and time constraints, conservation biologists are increasingly prioritizing
species on the basis of their overall contribution to evolutionary diversity.
Metrics such as EDGE (Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered) have been
successfully used to set such evolutionarily-based conservation priorities for a
number of taxa, such as mammals, birds, corals, amphibians, and sharks. Each of
these applications of EDGE has required some form of correction for species
whose position within the tree of life are unknown. Perhaps the most advanced of
these corrections is phylogenetic imputation, but to date there has been no
systematic assessment of the impact of both missing species and imputation to
correct for them. Here we perform such a systematic assessment, simulating the
random missingness of species from a phylogeny, the imputation of the position
of those species, and measure the impact each of these processes has on
accurately estimating species' true EDGE scores. We find that EDGE ranking is
remarkably robust to missing species, and that phylogenetic imputation, while
unbiased, is not accurate in reconstructing species' true evolutionary
distinctiveness. On the basis of these results, we provide clear guidance for
EDGE scoring in the face of phylogenetic uncertainty.

\textbf{Keywords}: conservation prioritization, evolutionary distinctiveness, 
EDGE, phylogenetic imputation.

\section*{Introduction}

Evidence from the fossil record and present-day studies argue we are in the
midst of, or entering, a sixth mass extinction \autocite{Barnosky2011,
Ceballos2015}, such that more populations than ever are declining and species
face heightened danger of extinction \autocite{Wake2008, Thomas2004}. Habitat
destruction \autocite{Brooks2002}, invasive species \autocite{Molnar2008},
climate change \autocite{Pounds2006}, and disease \autocite{Lips2006} are some
of the leading causes of species declines globally. Conservation biologists seek
to reduce these detrimental effects on species populations, but in reality they
have limited resources with which to do so. This challenge, termed the “Noah's
Ark problem” \autocite{Weitzman1998}, has driven conservation biologists
identify different ways by which to prioritize, or triage, their resource
allocation \autocite{Bottrill2008}.

Conservation triage, like all sound decision-making, requires an index  with
which to quantify the relative urgency or importance for conservation among a
set of options. This allows scientists and policy-makers to use data to quantify
need and inform conservation decision-making and management activities. One such
triage strategy uses the EDGE metric to identify and prioritize species that are
Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered \autocite{Isaac2007}.
Evolutionary Distinctiveness (ED) measures the relative contributions to
phylogenetic diversity made by each species within a particular clade, assigning
each branch length equally to all the subtending species \autocite{Isaac2007},
Global Endangerment (GE), assigns numerical values to each of the World
Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List Categories. As species become increasingly
threatened and are placed into categories of increasing concern (\emph{e.g.}
from Vulnerable to Endangered), the GE numerical value increases. Species' EDGE
score is intended to equally reflect a species' evolutionary distinctiveness and
conservation status \autocite[even if it does not always in practice; see][]{Pearse2015}.

Though originally used to prioritize global mammals, the EDGE metric has
subsequently been applied to a variety of taxonomic groups, including amphibians
\autocite{Isaac2012}, birds \autocite{Jetz2014}, corals \autocite{Curnick2015},
squamate reptiles \autocite{Tonini2016}, and sharks \autocite{Stein2018}.
Additional related metrics have also been developed, each emphasizing subtly
different things, such as the expected contribution of each species to future
phylogenetic diversity \autocite[HEDGE, I-HEDGE;][]{Steel2007,Jensen2016}, our
uncertainty over a species' future \autocite[EDAM;][]{Pearse2015}, and the
complementarity of a set of species \autocite{Faith2008}. The development and
expansion of EDGE-like metrics mirrors progress in other areas of conservation
biology, where the likelihood of success in conservation \autocite{Wilson2007,
Mcbride2007}, relative cost of certain interventions \autocite{Naidoo2006}, and
complementarity of interventions \autocite{Pressey1993, Myers2000} have received
attention. The EDGE index was developed explicitly with the intention of
informing conservation triage, and is now the basis of the global EDGE of
Existence Program (http://www.edgeofexistence.org/). The successful application
of EDGE in this program highlights the potential for phylogenetic conservation
prioritization metrics to provide actionable insights in the face of uncertainty
about species' attributes. Nonetheless, almost every application of an EDGE-type
approach has to deal with the uncertainty resulting from missing data.

Missing data can affect confidence in EDGE scores in several ways. First, the
IUCN identifies some species as Data Deficient \autocite{Iucn2001, Iucn2008}.
which will affect the GE component of a species' EDGE score. Fortunately, the
IUCN provides guidance for using any available contextual data to assign some
threat status to such species. A number of studies illustrate how to assign
threat categories to Data Deficient species, which in turn should reduce the
uncertainty in GE \autocite{Good2006, Butchart2010, Morais2013, Dulvy2014}. The
issue of missing phylogenetic data is arguably more complicated than that of
missing threat data because not only does the focal species have no ED score,
but its missingness may affect ED scores of related species. Species of
conservation concern are almost by definition rare, and frequently lack
sufficient DNA (or even morphological) data to be placed with certainty on a
phylogeny. For most empirical EDGE lists, taxonomic information rather than
sequence data alone is used to place species in the tree of life
\autocite[see][]{Isaac2007, Collen2011, Isaac2012, Jetz2014, Curnick2015,
Stein2018, Gumbs2017}. Yet, to our knowledge, there has yet to be a systematic
study of the effect of such imputation on species' EDGE scores, unlike in other
aspects of comparative biology \autocite{Kuhn2011, Thomas2013, Rabosky2014}.
Thus we do not know the fidelity of EDGE scores between imputed and non-imputed
phylogenies or the magnitude of error phylogenetic imputation introduces. As the
desire to use EDGE-type measures and phylogenies for conservation triage grows,
the need for consensus on how to resolve cases of phylogenetic uncertainty
becomes increasingly urgent.

Here we attempt to first quantify the effect of missing species on EDGE rankings
and then assess the degree to which imputation overcomes the effect of missing
phylogenetic data. We do so by simulating phylogenies and missing species that
are distributed either at random, or with bias, across those phylogenies. By
contrasting the ED scores of the species before and after the loss of other
species from the phylogenies, we measure the impact of missing species on ED
scores. We then assess the extent to which phylogenetic imputation can
accurately estimate the EDGE scores of missing species in simulated data. We
also examine the extent to which such imputation affects the scores of species
for which we have data. In so doing, we hope to provide clear guidance as to the
applicability of phylogenetic imputation as a solution for species missing
phylogenetic data. From our results, we argue that species' ED values are
remarkably robust to missing species, and that phylogenetic imputation does not
reliably reconstruct the true ranking of those missing species.

\section*{Methods}

Here we use a simulation approach to test the effect of missing species (through
species removal from simulated phylogenies) and imputing species on a phylogeny
on species' ED (Evolutionary Distinctiveness) scores. We focus exclusively on
the ED-component of the EDGE metric, since uncertainty in species GE scores has
already been addressed by the IUCN's proposal to assign Data Deficient species
scores \autocite{Iucn2001, Iucn2008}. Because EDGE is the product of both ED and
GE components, even perfectly accurate GE values could
be associated with imperfect EDGE scores if the ED scores were inaccurate.


All simulations and analyses were performed using R \autocite[version
3.4.0;][]{R2017}, and we performed 100 replicate simulations of each parameter
combination. All trees (both starting and imputed) were simulated under a
pure-birth Yule model using \texttt{sim.bdtree} in \texttt{geiger}
\autocite[setting parameters \texttt{b=1} and \texttt{d=0};][]{Pennell2014}.
This model was chosen because it is the simplest model possible: speciation
rates are constant across the entire tree of life and there is no extinction. We
acknowledge that more complex and/or biologically realistic models of
diversification could potentially improve the performance of imputation.
However, we suggest that imputation under a simple model that is identical to
that used to simulate the data is a low, and fair, benchmark for a method to
meet. We used \texttt{ed.calc} \texttt{caper} to calculate ED values
\autocite{Orme2013}. All our analysis code is available online
(\url{https://github.com/bweedop/edgeSims}) and in the supplementary materials.


\subsection*{The impact of missing species on EDGE scores}
Our first set of simulations assess the impact of missing species data on the ED
scores of remaining species, considering data missing either in a random or
phylogenetically-biased fashion. We simulated phylogenies of different sizes
(number of species: 64, 128, 256, ..., 2048, 4096) and then removed constant
fractions of tips from the tree (0\%, 1\%, 2\%, ..., 19\%, ..., 99\%). To
simulate species missing at random throughout the phylogeny,
we used \texttt{sample} to select the relevant fraction of
species (rounded to the nearest whole number) without replacement. To remove
species in a phylogenetically-biased manner, we used
\textcite{Felsenstein2005}'s threshold model. First, we simulated a trait under
a constant rate Brownian-motion model ($\sigma$=0.5, starting root value = 1)
using \texttt{sim.char} in \texttt{geiger} 
\autocite{Pennell2014}. Species were then removed from the tree if their
simulated trait was in the upper quantile matching the fraction of species to be
removed. For example, if 10\% of species were to be removed from the tree,
the species with the highest 10\% of values would be removed. This
results in closely related species being removed more often than expected by chance.

To quantify the effect of these manipulations, we calculated the ED values of
species that are not removed from a tree both before and after removal.
We then correlated these ED scores: if missing species do not affect ED
values, we would expect a strong, positive correlation between the ED scores
calculated before and after species were removed from the phylogeny. Note that
species removed from the phylogeny are omitted from this comparison. We outline
our approach in figure \ref{missingSpecies}.

  \caption{\textbf{Example of simulated phylogenies and ED values used to
  compare species ED values.} The simulated tree on the left is the true tree
  prior to removal of missing species. On the right is the same tree after
  missing species have been removed. Species that are removed are shown in red.
  We correlate the remaining ED values to
  compare the ED values. Dashed lines can be seen for the species which would
  have ED scores compared.}
  \label{missingSpecies}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{The impact of phylogenetic imputation on EDGE scores}
Our second set of simulations tested the impact of imputation on ED scores
within an imputed clade. We used relatively small clades (5, 6, 7, ..., 30, 31,
32 species) from phylogenies of different sizes [128 ($2^7$), 147 ($2^{7.2}$,
168 ($2^{7.4}$), ... , 776 ($2^{9.6}$), 891 ($2^{9.8}$), 1024 ($2^{10}$)
species). We first randomly selected a clade to be removed from the ‘true' tree
and then simulated a new phylogeny of the same size as the removed clade. This
newly simulated clade was generated under the same pure-birth model as the
original phylogeny. We then placed the newly simulated clade in the full
phylogeny, in the same location as the removed clade. If a newly simulated clade
was so old that it was not possible to graft it into place, we discarded that
clade and simulated another. In an empirical study the model of evolution under
which the clade would be simulated would have to be estimated, which is an
additional source of error not considered here. We simulated each combination of
clade and total phylogeny sizes 100 times. An overview of our approach is given
in \ref{imputeConcept}. 

To assess whether clades, once imputed, had similar ED scores, we correlated the
imputed ED scores with the true ED scores. We also calculated the sum of the
absolute change in ranked ED for each species, which is particularly relevant
for EDGE-listing as it is often the top 100, 200, etc., species on which
conservation actions are targeted. We modeled both of these metrics (the change
in ranking and the correlation) as a function of a number of potential
explanatory variables. Specifically, we included in our models: the estimated
speciation rate of the original phylogeny \autocite[using
\texttt{ape::yule};][]{Paradis2004}, the sum of all phylogenetic branch-lengths
in the original phylogeny \autocite[Faith's PD;][]{Faith1992}, the sum of all
phylogenetic branch-lengths in the original focal clade \autocite[Faith's
PD;][]{Faith1992}, the value of gamma in the original phylogeny \autocite[using
\texttt{phytools::gammatest};][]{Pybus2000, Revell2012}, colless' index of the
original phylogeny
\autocite[using\texttt{apTreeshape::as.treeshape};][]{Colless1982,
Bortolussi2009}, the kurtosis of species' ED values in the original phylogeny
\autocite[using \texttt{moments::kurtosis};][]{Komsta2015}, the skew of species'
ED values in the original phylogeny \autocite[using
\texttt{moments::skew};][]{Komsta2015}, the total number of species in the
original phylogeny, the total number of species within the imputed clade, and
the depth (age) of the imputed clade in the phylogeny. Although the expectations
of many of these explanatory variables are known for Yule trees, in each
simulation they are expected to vary somewhat by chance.

Recently, there has been interest in assigning missing species the
mean ED score within a clade \autocite[see][]{Gumbs2017}. To test the
efficacy of such methods, , we assigned the average ED of the selected
clade to each of its' species and calculated (as above) the mean
change in absolute ranking under this scheme. Note that we could not
correlate ED scores, as we could with the imputation method described
above, since to calculate a correlation requires variation in species'
scores.

  \caption{\textbf{Conceptual overview of the simulations conducted in this
  study.} In (a), the simulated tree on the left is the ‘true tree' prior to
  removal of missing species. On the right is the same tree after the removal of
  missing species. We calculated ED values for both the true tree and the
  incomplete tree, and calculated the correlation between ED values for species
  common between these trees (indicated with dashed lines) to measure the impact
  of missing species on known species' scores. In (b), the simulated tree on the
  left is the ‘true tree'. We selected a clade to treat as ‘missing'
  (highlighted with a dashed line) by replacing it with a polytomy (middle
  panel), and then imputed the ‘missing' species following the procedure
  described in the Methods to produce the imputed clade (dashed line) in the
  right panel. To compare true and imputed ED values within the imputed clade,
  we correlated ED values calculated on the true clade with those for the
  imputed clade. }
  \label{imputeConcept}
\end{figure}

\section*{Results}
With increasing numbers of missing species, species' ED scores become less accurate (Table 1;
figure \ref{randomVsClustered}). ED values were less robust to
phylogenetically-biased missing species, as compared to those that are randomly
missing from the tree. The effect of missing species is not necessarily severe;
if 20\% of species are missing, the average correlation
between true and estimated ED is 0.88 and 0.94 for phylogenetically-biased and
random missing species, respectively.

\end{table}

When clades were imputed on the tree, we found no average positive correlation
between the imputed ED and true ED values for species within the imputed clades
(figure \ref{imputationTrend}, table 2). The mean correlation was 0.
We also found no explanatory variables that explained significant variation in
this relationship (table 2; see also Supplementary Materials). However, we did
find evidence that, when imputing larger clades, the variation in the
correlation between true and imputed ED scores decreases, although it remains
centered around 0 (see Supplementary Materials). When considering rankings
rather than raw scores, we similarly found large effects of imputation for the
imputed species (figure \ref{rankingError} and table 4). This ranking error
increased with the size of the imputed clade and phylogeny (table 4), and can
affect ranking error within the top 100 and 250 species (see Supplementary
Materials). To give an example of the magnitude of the effect, within a
phylogeny of 1024 species, the members of an imputed clade of 30 species are, on
average, $\pm$ 315 rankings from their true rankings.
We found similar effects in ranking error when using the average
ED value of clade for a missing species (see Supplementary Materials).

\section*{Discussion}
Phylogenies are increasingly playing a role in conservation prioritization,
decision-making, and policy \autocite{Vezquez1998}. A major obstacle to a more
widespread adoption of phylogenetic prioritization methods such as EDGE is
phylogenetic uncertainty \autocite{Collen2015}. There is a tension between the
need to make decisions to preserve biodiversity---including evolutionary history
---now, and the reality that we do not have complete information about the
phylogenetic placement of many species of conservation concern. The intention of
our study is to provide concrete information about the impact of such
phylogenetic uncertainty on conservation prioritization. To address this
uncertainty, we answered two key questions: (1) the extent to which species that
are missing from the tree of life impact the ED scores of species for which we
do have data, and (2) the extent to which phylogenetic imputation can accurately
fill in ED scores for taxa with no phylogenetic data. For the first question
(1), we found that while missing species do impact the ED scores of other
species, the effects are not always severe, particularly if species are missing
at random from the tree of life. For the second question (2), we found limited
evidence that phylogenetic imputation can reconstruct species' ED scores and
rankings.

Our results are derived solely from simulations under a simple model of
diversification---the Yule model. We do acknowledge that, in reality, lineages
evolve in more complex ways than are captured by such a simple model. However,
such complexities are unlikely to make imputation easier, and as they would have
to be modelled and quantified, they would likely make imputation more difficult.
We suggest that focusing on the simplest model of diversification makes our
results more generalizable. Further, we focus here solely on the results from a
single imputation in each simulation, despite, empirically, biologists reporting
average ED scores calculated across pseudo-posterior distributions of many
imputed phylogenies \autocite{Kuhn2011}. Thus our results show that the
variation within these pseuo-posterior distributions is likely very large. It is
well-known that such imputation methods are not biased \autocite[indeed, this
was originally shown by][]{Kuhn2011}: here we emphasize that the uncertainty
they introduce is sufficiently large that they may be less informative than
previously been thought.

\subsection*{ED scores are relatively robust to missing species}
Missing species and poor phylogenetic resolution have been identified as causes
of uncertainty when calculating ED \autocite{Isaac2007}, but we were unable to
find a quantitative assessment of how missing species might affect ED values of
species for which data is available. Empirically in corals, incomplete phylogenies
produced similar results as later, more complete trees \autocite{Curnick2015}.
Our results support this finding. Indeed, our analysis suggests that, on average
(and we emphasize that there is a good amount of variation about that average;
see figure \ref{randomVsClustered}), a phylogeny missing 20\% of species at random will
still have ED scores that are strongly correlated ($r$=0.94) with the true ED
scores.

We did find that missing species are more problematic when those species are
non-randomly distributed across the phylogeny. Our simulations do not examine
extreme phylogenetic patterning, such as if an entire clade were missing; this
is notable because clades that are geographically restricted to
difficult-to-reach regions are both difficult to sequence and not uncommon
\autocite[as is seen with 27 coral species in the Indian
Ocean;][]{Arrigoni2012}. Thus these results are likely conservative. We also do
not attempt to comprehensively simulate all of the different ways in which
species could be missing from a phylogeny. We simply demonstrate that, compared
to a scenario in which species are missing at random,
phylogenetically patterned missing species can have a greater effect on the ED
scores of species for which we have data.

\subsection*{Imputation does not reconstruct the ED value of species with great precision}
Our results show that imputation does not accurately recover the true ED values
or the true ED rank of missing species (figure \ref{imputationTrend}; figure
\ref{rankingError}). Thus we argue that, even though imputation allows missing
species to be incorporated into EDGE lists, their associated EDGE scores may not
accurately reflect their true scores. We acknowledge these are averages and may
change depending on particular phylogeny, but we can find no statistically
significant predictors of that variation.

While we did not assess clades with fewer than five species (we do not consider
correlations or averages to be reliable with so few data-points), we cannot
think why smaller clades would necessarily be more reliable (and this would be a
reversal of the trend in figure \ref{imputationTrend}). Indeed, in the smallest
possible clade (two species), imputation is essentially sampling a terminal
branch length from an exponential distribution \autocite{Kuhn2011}; such a
process should still lead to a great degree of uncertainty. Further, smaller
sample sizes should not lead to a more accurate estimate. It is, perhaps,
unsurprising that imputed ED values do not correlate with their true values (see
figure \ref{imputationTrend}), but we were surprised at the degree of ranking error.
Indeed, larger phylogenies showed \emph{greater} ranking error; we na\"{i}vely
would have expected the opposite. We would have expected our upper bound on the
age of the imputed clade, which we would have expected to be relatively younger
in larger phylogenies, to have somewhat controlled the range of the ranks of our
imputed species. ED is known to be driven mostly by terminal branch length
\autocite{Redding2008, Isaac2007, Steel2007}; our results therefore emphasize
this.

Imputation is not the only way to incorporate missing species into EDGE-like
frameworks \autocite{Gumbs2017, Collen2011}, but it is likely the most common.
$3,330$ of the birds \autocite[\textasciitilde30\%;][]{Jetz2014}, 250 of the mammals
\autocite[\textasciitilde 5.6\%;][]{Collen2011}, and 610 of the sharks
\autocite[\textasciitilde49\%;][]{Stein2018} in recent EDGE lists were imputed.
It is well-known that phylogenetic imputation can cause biases in other
statistical methods, such as the estimation of evolutionary phylogenetic signal
\autocite{Rabosky2014}. We emphasize that we are not suggesting that imputation
\emph{biases} ED scores: we are, instead, suggesting that it is less precise
than has previously been acknowledged.

\subsection*{Guidelines for the use of imputation}
The impact of imputation on EDGE scores is almost certainly less than its impact
on ED scores, because EDGE scores are a product of both ED and IUCN status
(‘GE'). However, the goal of EDGE-like measures is to incorporate phylogeny, and
if imputed EDGE scores are driven by their GE component because of uncertainty
introduced by imputation, this essentially creates another metric of IUCN
status.

Our results suggest that incomplete phylogenies can be used to estimate ED
scores with remarkably high degrees of accuracy. Instead of using imputation to
account for the relatively minor impact of missing species, we suggest
conservation biologists should focus on accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty
in the species for which they have data. While we have not explored this
uncertainty here, evolutionary biologists commonly work with distributions of
trees generated from genetic data \autocite[reviewed in][]{Huelsenbeck2001,
Bollback2005}, since the precise topology and dating of a phylogeny is almost
always uncertain. This uncertainty has, indeed, already been shown to affect
EDGE scores and rankings \autocite{Pearse2015}. We suggest conservation
biologists should focus on averaging across known phylogenetic uncertainty as a
priority. There is, of course, nothing stopping biologists from also using
taxonomy to impute the positions of missing species within the phylogeny: being
thorough is a virtue, but it is important to focus on the major sources of
potential error first.

Our results suggest that prioritizing species whose phylogenetic structure has
been imputed should be done with extreme care, if it at all. In the case that an
imputed species is imputed to be below a threshold set for conservation (most
EDGE studies focus on the ‘top 100' species or something similar), then the path
forward is clear: that species should not have conservation funds allocated to
it at this time. The case where a species, on average, passes a threshold is
more complex, but the theory underlying imputation can give some guidance.
Imputed distributions of trees essentially represent Bayesian posterior
distributions \autocite{Kuhn2011}, and so the 95\% posterior densities of these
distributions' ED values represent a range within which we can be 95\% certain
the true ED scores lie (if the model assumptions are met). Thus we suggest that
conservation action should only be initiated for a species if there is a 95\%
(or 80\%, or whatever confidence is deemed appropriate) probability that it is
above that threshold. Thus a species whose ranking is estimated to have a 95\%
probability of being between the \nth{30} and \nth{300} highest-ranked species
could not, with confidence, be called a top-100 species. Our results suggest
that, on average, very few imputed species will meet such a criterion.

Ultimately, we are currently fighting a losing battle to preserve the tree of
life. Our results are good news: they suggest that we can start right away using
the phylogenies we already have in-hand. The effect of missing species is mild
enough that we often do not need costly and time-consuming imputation, and
imputation rarely gives us sufficiently precise estimates of species' ED scores
anyway. We suggest that, given we do not have the resources to save everything,
we should consider focusing our efforts on those species whose ED scores we can
know with greater certainty: those for which we have data.
