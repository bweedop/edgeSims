\section*{Abstract}

Faced with the challenge of saving as much diversity as possible given financial
and time constraints, conservation biologists are increasingly prioritizing
species on the basis of their overall contribution to evolutionary diversity.
Metrics such as EDGE (Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered) have been
used to set such evolutionarily-based conservation priorities for a number of
taxa, such as mammals, birds, corals, amphibians, and sharks. Each application
of EDGE has required some form of correction to account for species whose
position within the tree of life are unknown. Perhaps the most advanced of these
corrections is phylogenetic imputation, but to date there has been no systematic
assessment of both the sensitivity of EDGE scores to a phylogeny missing
species, and the impact of  using imputation to correct for this. Here we
perform such a systematic assessment, simulating incomplete phylogenies from
which some species are missing, then imputating the position of those species,
and measuring the impact each of these processes has on accurately estimating
species’ true EDGE scores. We find that EDGE ranking for species on a tree is
remarkably robust to missing species from that tree, but  that phylogenetic
imputation for missing species, while unbiased, is not accurate in
reconstructing species’ true evolutionary distinctiveness. On the basis of these
results, we provide clear guidance for EDGE scoring in the face of phylogenetic
uncertainty.

\textbf{Keywords}: conservation prioritization, evolutionary distinctiveness,

\section*{Introduction}

Evidence from the fossil record and present-day studies argue we are in the
midst of, or entering, a sixth mass extinction \autocite{Barnosky2011,
Ceballos2015}, such that more populations than ever are declining and species
face heightened danger of extinction \autocite{Wake2008, Thomas2004}. Habitat
destruction \autocite{Brooks2002}, invasive species \autocite{Molnar2008},
climate change \autocite{Pounds2006}, and disease \autocite{Lips2006} are some
of the leading causes of species declines globally. Conservation biologists seek
to reduce these detrimental effects on species populations, but in reality they
have limited resources with which to do so. This challenge, termed the “Noah's
Ark problem” \autocite{Weitzman1998}, has driven conservation biologists to
identify different ways by which to prioritize, or triage, their resource
allocation \autocite{Bottrill2008}.

Conservation triage, like all sound decision-making, requires an index  with
which to quantify the relative urgency or importance for conservation among a
set of options. This allows scientists and policy-makers to use data to quantify
need and inform conservation decision-making and management activities. One
triage strategy uses the EDGE metric to identify and prioritize species that are
Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered \autocite{Isaac2007}.
Evolutionary Distinctiveness (ED) measures the relative contributions made by
each species within a particular clade to phylogenetic diversity, assigning each
branch length equally to all the subtending species \autocite{Redding2003,
Isaac2007}. Global Endangerment (GE), assigns numerical values to each of the
World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List Categories. As species become
increasingly threatened and are placed into categories of increasing concern
(\emph{e.g.} from Vulnerable to Endangered), the GE numerical value increases. A
species’ EDGE score is an aggregate value intended to equally reflect a
species’ evolutionary distinctiveness and conservation status \autocite[even if
it does not always in practice; see][]{Pearse2015}.

Usage of the EDGE metric has expanded greatly. Though originally used to
prioritize global mammals, EDGE scores are now available now for a variety of
taxonomic groups, including amphibians \autocite{Isaac2012}, birds
\autocite{Jetz2014}, corals \autocite{Curnick2015}, squamate reptiles
\autocite{Tonini2016}, sharks \autocite{Stein2018}, and all tetrapods
\autocite{Gumbs2018}. Related metrics are also now available, each subtly
emphasizing different things, such as the expected contribution of each species
to future phylogenetic diversity \autocite[HEDGE,
I-HEDGE;][]{Steel2007,Jensen2016}, our uncertainty over a species' future
\autocite[EDAM;][]{Pearse2015}, and the complementarity of a set of species
\autocite{Faith2003}. The development and expansion of EDGE-like metrics mirrors
progress in other areas of conservation biology, and as such the likelihood of
success in conservation \autocite{Wilson2007, Mcbride2007}, relative cost of
certain interventions \autocite{Naidoo2006}, and complementarity of
interventions \autocite{Pressey1993, Myers2000} can now be considered in its
calculation. The EDGE index was developed explicitly with the intention of
informing conservation triage, and is now the basis of the global EDGE of
Existence Program (http://www.edgeofexistence.org/). The successful application
of EDGE in this program highlights the potential for phylogenetic conservation
prioritization metrics to provide actionable insights in the face of uncertainty
about species’ attributes. Nonetheless, almost every application of an EDGE-type
approach must address uncertainty resulting from missing data.

Missing data can affect EDGE scores in several ways. First, the IUCN identifies
some species as Data Deficient \autocite{Iucn2001, Iucn2008}, which affects the
GE component of a species' EDGE score. Fortunately, the IUCN provides guidance
for using any available contextual data to assign some threat status to such
species. A number of studies illustrate how to assign threat categories to Data
Deficient species, which in turn should reduce the uncertainty in GE
\autocite{Good2006, Butchart2010, Morais2013, Dulvy2014}. The issue of missing
phylogenetic data is arguably more complicated because not only does the focal
species have no ED score, but its absence from the phylogeny may affect the ED
scores of related species. Species of conservation concern are almost by
definition rare, and frequently lack sufficient DNA (or even morphological) data
to be placed with certainty on a phylogeny. In most cases, taxonomic information
rather than sequence data alone has been used to place species in the tree of
life when constructing EDGE lists \autocite[see][]{Isaac2007, Collen2011,
Isaac2012, Jetz2014, Curnick2015, Stein2018, Gumbs2018, Forest2018}. Yet, to our
knowledge, there is no systematic study of the effect of imputation on species’
EDGE scores, despite this practice having received attention in other areas of
comparative biology \autocite{Kuhn2011, Thomas2013, Rabosky2015}. Thus we do not
know the fidelity of EDGE scores between imputed and non-imputed phylogenies or
the magnitude of error that phylogenetic imputation introduces. As interest in
using EDGE-type measures and phylogenies for conservation triage grows, the need
for consensus on how to resolve cases of phylogenetic uncertainty becomes
increasingly urgent.

Here we attempt to quantify the effect of missing species on EDGE rankings and
assess the degree to which subsequent imputation affects the accuracy of EDGE
scores. We do so by simulating phylogenies and missing species that are
distributed either at random, or with bias, across those phylogenies. By
contrasting the ED scores of the species before and after the loss of other
species from the phylogenies, we measure the impact of missing species on ED
scores. We then assess the extent to which phylogenetic imputation can
accurately estimate the EDGE scores of missing species in simulated data. We
also examine the extent to which such imputation affects the scores of species
for which we have data. In so doing, we hope to provide clear guidance as to the
applicability of phylogenetic imputation as a solution for species missing
phylogenetic data. From our results, we argue that species’ ED values are
remarkably robust to missing species, and that phylogenetic imputation does not
reliably reconstruct the true ranking of those missing species.

\section*{Methods}

Here we use a simulation approach to test the effect of having missing species
on a phylogeny (through species removal from simulated phylogenies) and then
imputing species for species’ ED (Evolutionary Distinctiveness) scores. We focus
exclusively on the ED-component of the EDGE metric, since uncertainty in species
GE scores has already been addressed by the IUCN’s proposal to assign Data
Deficient species scores \autocite{Iucn2001, Iucn2008}. Because EDGE is the
product of both ED and GE components, even perfectly accurate GE values could be
associated with imperfect EDGE scores if the ED scores were inaccurate.


All trees (both starting and imputed) were simulated under a pure-birth Yule
model using \texttt{sim.bdtree} in \texttt{geiger} \autocite[setting parameters
\texttt{b=1} and \texttt{d=0};][]{Pennell2014}. This model was chosen because it
is the simplest model possible: speciation rates are constant across the entire
tree of life and there is no extinction. We acknowledge that more complex and/or
biologically realistic models of diversification could potentially improve the
performance of imputation. However, we suggest that imputation under a simple
model that is identical to that used to simulate the data is a low, and fair,
benchmark for a method to meet. We used \texttt{caper::ed.calc} to calculate ED
values \autocite{Orme2013}. All simulations and analyses were performed using R
\autocite[version 3.4.0;][]{R2017}, and we performed 100 replicate simulations
of each parameter combination. All our analysis code is available online
(\url{https://github.com/bweedop/edgeSims}) and in the supplementary materials.


\subsection*{The impact of missing species on EDGE scores}
Our first set of simulations assess the impact of missing species data on the ED
scores of remaining species, considering data missing either in a random or
phylogenetically-biased fashion. We simulated phylogenies of different sizes
(number of species: 64, 128, 256, ..., 2048, 4096) and then removed constant
fractions of tips from the tree (0\%, 1\%, 2\%, ..., 19\%, ..., 99\%). To
simulate species missing at random throughout the phylogeny, we used
\texttt{sample}() to select the relevant fraction of species (rounded to the
nearest whole number) without replacement. To remove species in a
phylogenetically-biased manner, we used \textcite{Felsenstein2005}'s threshold
model. We simulated a trait under a constant rate Brownian-motion model
($\sigma$=0.5, starting root value = 1) using \texttt{sim.char} in
\texttt{geiger} \autocite{Pennell2014}. Species were then removed from the tree
if their simulated trait was in the upper quantile matching the fraction of
species to be removed. For example, if 10\% of species were to be removed from
the tree, the species with the highest 10\% of values would be removed. This
results in closely related species being removed more often than expected by
chance.

To quantify the effect of these manipulations, we calculated the ED values of
species that are not removed from a tree both before and after removal. We then
correlated these ED scores: if missing species do not affect ED values of the
remaining species, we would expect a strong, positive correlation between the ED
scores of the remaining species calculated before and after species were removed
from the phylogeny. We emphasize that species removed from the phylogeny are
omitted from this comparison. We outline our approach in figure
\ref{missingSpecies}.

  \caption{\textbf{Conceptual overview of the missing-species simulations in
  this study.} The simulated tree on the left is the true tree prior to removal
  of missing species. On the right is the same tree after missing species have
  been removed. Species that are removed are shown in red. To compare the ED
  values of the remaining species, we correlate their ED values before (left)
  and after (right) removal of the missing species. Dashed lines can be seen for
  the species which would have ED scores compared.}
  \label{missingSpecies}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{The impact of phylogenetic imputation on EDGE scores}
Our second set of simulations tested the impact of imputation on ED scores
within an imputed clade. We used relatively small clades (5, 6, 7, ..., 30, 31,
32 species) from phylogenies of different sizes [128 ($2^7$), 147 ($2^{7.2}$,
168 ($2^{7.4}$), ... , 776 ($2^{9.6}$), 891 ($2^{9.8}$), 1024 ($2^{10}$)
species). We first randomly selected a clade to be removed from the ‘true' tree
and then simulated a new phylogeny of the same size as the removed clade. This
newly simulated clade was generated under the same pure-birth model as the
original phylogeny. We then placed the newly simulated clade in the full
phylogeny, in the same location as the removed clade. If a newly simulated clade
was so old that it was not possible to graft it into place, we discarded that
clade and simulated another. In an empirical study the model of evolution under
which the phylogeny had evolved would have to be estimated, which is an
additional source of error not considered here. We simulated each combination of
clade and total phylogeny sizes 100 times. An overview of our approach is given
in figure \ref{imputeConcept}. 

To assess whether clades, once imputed, had similar ED scores to their true
values, we correlated the imputed ED scores with the true ED scores. We also
calculated the sum of the absolute change in ranked ED for each species, which
is particularly relevant for EDGE-listing as conservation actions are often
focused around the top 100, 200, etc., species. We modeled both of these metrics
(the change in ranking and the correlation) as a function of a number of
potential explanatory variables. Specifically, we included in our models: the
estimated speciation rate of the original phylogeny \autocite[using
\texttt{ape::yule};][]{Paradis2004}, the sum of all phylogenetic branch-lengths
in the original phylogeny \autocite[Faith's PD;][]{Faith1992}, the sum of all
phylogenetic branch-lengths in the original focal clade \autocite[Faith's
PD;][]{Faith1992}, the value of $\gamma$ in the original phylogeny
\autocite[using \texttt{phytools::gammatest};][]{Pybus2000, Revell2012},
Colless' index of the original phylogeny
\autocite[using \texttt{apTreeshape::as.treeshape};][]{Colless1982,
Bortolussi2009}, the kurtosis of species' ED values in the original phylogeny
\autocite[using \texttt{moments::kurtosis};][]{Komsta2015}, the skew of species'
ED values in the original phylogeny \autocite[using
\texttt{moments::skew};][]{Komsta2015}, the total number of species in the
original phylogeny, the total number of species within the imputed clade, and
the depth (age) of the imputed clade in the phylogeny. Although the expectations
of many of these explanatory variables are known for Yule trees, in each
simulation they are expected to vary somewhat by chance.

Recently, there has been interest in assigning missing species the mean ED score
within a clade \autocite[see][]{Gumbs2018}. To test the efficacy of such
methods, we assigned the average ED of the selected clade to each of its'
species and calculated (as above) the mean change in absolute ranking under this
scheme. Note that we could not correlate ED scores (as we do above), since such
a correlation would require variation in species' scores and under this approach
a single score (the mean ED) is assigned to all imputed species.

  \center
  \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{imputeConcept.png}
  \caption{\textbf{Conceptual overview of the imputation simulations conducted
  in this study.} The simulated tree on the left is the ‘true tree'. We selected
  a clade to treat as ‘missing' (highlighted with a dashed line and in blue) by
  replacing it with a polytomy (middle panel), and then imputed the ‘missing'
  species following the procedure described in the Methods to produce the
  imputed clade in the right panel. To compare true and imputed ED values within
  the imputed clade, we correlated ED values calculated for the true clade
  (left) with those for the imputed clade (right).}
  \label{imputeConcept}
\end{figure}

\section*{Results}
With increasing numbers of missing species from a phylogeny, remaining species’
ED scores become less accurate (table 1; figure \ref{randomVsClustered}). ED
values were less robust to phylogenetically-biased missing species, as compared
to those that are randomly missing from the tree. The effect of missing species
is not necessarily severe, however; if 20\% of species are missing, the average
correlation coefficient between true and estimated ED is 0.88 and 0.94 for
phylogenetically-biased and random missing species, respectively.

      removed from the tree and whether those species were removed at random or
      in a phylogenetically-biased fashion. The overall size of the phylogeny
      has little discernible effect, and its statistical significance is likely
      driven by the large number of simulations we performed ($139,700$).}
\label{missing_regression}
\end{table}

When clades were imputed on the tree, we found a weak (if any) average
positive correlation between the imputed ED and true ED values for
species within the imputed clades (overall mean correlation of
$0.197$ in a statistical model with an $r^2$ of
$0.5\%$; figure \ref{imputationTrend}, table 2). We also found no
explanatory variables that explained significant variation in this
relationship (table 2; see also Supplementary Materials). However, we
did find evidence that, when imputing larger clades, the variation in
the correlation between true and imputed ED scores decreases, although
we emphasise the effect is weak (see table 2). When
considering rankings rather than raw scores, we similarly found that
imputation can introduce error into the estimation of species' ED
values (figure \ref{rankingError} and table \ref{impute_rank}). This
ranking error increased with the size of the imputed clade and
phylogeny (table \ref{impute_rank}), and can affect ranking error
within the top 100 and 250 species (see Supplementary Materials). To
give an example of the magnitude of the effect, within a phylogeny of
1024 species, the members of an imputed clade of 30 species are, on
average,
$\pm$ 315 rankings from their true rankings. We found
similar effects in ranking error when using the average ED value of
clade for a missing species (see Supplementary Materials).

\section*{Discussion}
Phylogenies are increasingly playing a role in conservation prioritization,
decision-making, and policy \autocite{Vezquez1998}. A major obstacle to a more
widespread adoption of phylogenetic prioritization methods such as EDGE is
phylogenetic uncertainty \autocite{Collen2015}. There is a tension between the
need to make decisions to preserve biodiversity---including evolutionary history
---now, and the reality that we do not have complete information about the
phylogenetic placement of many species of conservation concern \autocite{Isaac2018}.
The intention of our study is to provide
concrete information about the impact of such phylogenetic uncertainty on
conservation prioritization. To address this uncertainty, we addressed two key
issues: (1) the extent to which species that are missing from the tree of
life impact the ED scores of species for which we do have data, and (2) the
extent to which phylogenetic imputation can accurately estimate ED scores for
taxa with no phylogenetic data. First, we found that while
missing species do impact the ED scores of other species, the effects are not
always severe, particularly if species are missing at random from the tree of
life. Second, we found limited evidence that phylogenetic
imputation can reconstruct species' ED scores and rankings.

Our results are derived solely from simulations under a simple model of
diversification---the Yule model. We do acknowledge that, in reality, lineages
evolve in more complex ways than are captured by such a simple model. However,
such complexities are unlikely to make imputation easier, and as they would have
to be modelled and quantified in empirical studies, they would likely make
imputation more difficult and uncertain. We suggest that focusing on the
simplest model of diversification makes our results more generalizable. Further,
we focus here solely on the results from a single imputation in each simulation,
despite, empirically, biologists reporting average ED scores calculated across
pseudo-posterior distributions of many imputed phylogenies \autocite{Kuhn2011}.
Thus our results show that the variation within these pseuo-posterior
distributions is likely very large. It is well-known that such imputation
methods are not biased \autocite[indeed, this was originally shown
by][]{Kuhn2011}: here we emphasize that the uncertainty they introduce is
sufficiently large such that they may be less informative than previously has been
thought.

\subsection*{ED scores are relatively robust to missing species}
Missing species and poor phylogenetic resolution have been identified as causes
of uncertainty when calculating ED \autocite{Isaac2007}, but we were unable to
find a quantitative assessment of how missing species might affect ED values of
species for which data is available. Empirically in corals and gymnosperms,
incomplete phylogenies produced similar results as later, more complete trees
\autocite{Curnick2015, Forest2018}. Our results support this finding. Indeed,
our analysis suggests that, on average (and we emphasize that there is a good
amount of variation about that average; see figure \ref{randomVsClustered}), a
phylogeny missing 20\% of species at random will still have ED scores that are
strongly correlated (with a mean correlation coefficient of 0.94) with the true ED scores.

We did find that missing species are more problematic when those species are
non-randomly distributed across the phylogeny. Our simulations do not examine
extreme phylogenetic patterning, such as if an entire clade were missing. This
is notable because clades that are geographically restricted to
difficult-to-reach regions are both difficult to sequence and not uncommon
\autocite[as is seen with 27 coral species in the Indian
Ocean;][]{Arrigoni2012}. We also do not attempt to comprehensively simulate all
of the different ways in which species could be missing from a phylogeny. We
simply demonstrate that, compared to a scenario in which species are missing at
random, phylogenetically patterned missing species can have a greater effect on
the ED scores of species for which we have data.

\subsection*{Imputation does not reconstruct the ED values of missing species with great precision}
Our results show that neither imputation (figures \ref{imputationTrend} and
\ref{rankingError}), nor clade-averages of ED (see Supplementary Materials),
accurately recover the true ED values or the true ED rank of missing species.
Thus we argue that, even though imputation allows missing species to be
incorporated into EDGE lists, their associated EDGE scores may not accurately
reflect their true scores. We acknowledge these are averages and may change
depending on particular phylogeny, but we can find no statistically significant
predictors of that variation.

While we did not assess clades with fewer than five species (we do not consider
correlations or averages to be reliable with so few data-points), we cannot
think why smaller clades would necessarily be more reliable (and this would
require a large deviation from the trend in figure \ref{imputationTrend}). Indeed, in the smallest
possible clade (two species), imputation is essentially sampling a terminal
branch length from an exponential distribution \autocite{Kuhn2011}; such a
process should still lead to a great degree of uncertainty. It is, perhaps,
unsurprising that imputed ED values do not correlate with their true values (see
figure \ref{imputationTrend}), but we were surprised at the degree of ranking error.
Indeed, larger phylogenies showed \emph{greater} ranking error; we na\"{i}vely
would have expected the opposite. We would have expected our upper bound on the
age of the imputed clade, which we would have expected to be relatively younger
in larger phylogenies, to have somewhat controlled the range of the ranks of our
imputed species. ED is known to be driven mostly by terminal branch length
\autocite{Isaac2007, Steel2007, Redding2008}; our results therefore emphasize
this.

Imputation is not the only way to incorporate missing species into EDGE-like
frameworks \autocite[see][]{Collen2011,Gumbs2018}, but it is likely the most common.
$3,330$ of the birds \autocite[\textasciitilde30\%;][]{Jetz2014}, 250 of the mammals
\autocite[\textasciitilde 5.6\%;][]{Collen2011}, and 610 of the sharks
\autocite[\textasciitilde49\%;][]{Stein2018} in recent EDGE lists were imputed.
It is well-known that phylogenetic imputation can cause biases in other
statistical methods, such as the estimation of evolutionary phylogenetic signal
\autocite{Rabosky2015}. We emphasize that we are not suggesting that imputation
\emph{biases} ED scores: we are, instead, suggesting that it is less precise
than has previously been acknowledged.

\subsection*{Guidelines for the use of imputation}
The impact of imputation on EDGE scores is almost certainly less than its impact
on ED scores, because EDGE scores are a product of both ED and IUCN status
(‘GE'). However, the goal of EDGE-like measures is to incorporate phylogeny, and
if imputed EDGE scores are driven by their GE component because of uncertainty
introduced by imputation, this essentially creates another metric of IUCN
status.

Our results suggest that incomplete phylogenies can be used to estimate ED
scores with remarkably high degrees of accuracy. Instead of using imputation to
account for the relatively minor impact of missing species, we suggest that
conservation biologists concerned without accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty
should focus on the species for which they have data. While we have not explored this
uncertainty here, evolutionary biologists commonly work with distributions of
trees generated from genetic data \autocite[reviewed in][]{Huelsenbeck2001,
Bollback2005}, since the precise topology and dating of a phylogeny is almost
always uncertain. This uncertainty has, indeed, already been shown to affect
EDGE scores and rankings \autocite{Pearse2015}.
If biologists are concerned about the impact of missing species on known species'
ED(GE) scores we see no harm in being precautionary and using imputation. It is
important, however, to focus on known sources of potential error,
and so we would encourage biologists to incorporate uncertainty in species
with phylogenetic data as a priority.

Our results suggest that prioritizing species whose phylogenetic structure has
been imputed should be done with extreme care, if at all. In the case that an
species is imputed to be below a threshold set for conservation (most
EDGE studies focus on the ‘top 100' species or something similar), then the path
forward is clear: that species should not have conservation funds allocated to
it at this time. The case where a species, on average, passes a threshold is
more complex, but the theory underlying imputation can give some guidance.
Imputed distributions of trees essentially represent Bayesian posterior
distributions \autocite{Kuhn2011}, and so the 95\% posterior densities of these
distributions' ED values represent a range within which we can be 95\% certain
the true ED scores lie (if the model assumptions are met). Thus we suggest that
conservation action should only be initiated for a species if there is a 95\%
(or 80\%, or whatever confidence is deemed appropriate) probability that it is
above that threshold. For example, a species whose ranking is estimated to have a 20\%
probability of being between the \nth{1} and \nth{100} highest-ranked species
could not, with confidence, be called a top-100 species. Our results suggest
that, on average, very few imputed species will meet such a criterion.
Regardless, the calculations of such probabilities is trivial with the data
users of imputation have in hand already.

Ultimately, we are currently fighting a losing battle to preserve the tree of
life. Our results are good news: they suggest that we can start right away using
the phylogenies we already have. The effect of missing species is mild
enough that we often do not need costly and time-consuming imputation, and
imputation rarely gives us sufficiently precise estimates of species' ED scores
anyway. We suggest that, given we do not have the resources to save everything,
we should consider focusing our efforts on those species whose ED scores we can
know with greater certainty: those for which we have data.
