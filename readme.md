EDGE Score Simulations:

	The R scripts used here have been created in order to 1) simulate phylogenies under a pure-birth Yule model, 2) manipulate the simulated phylogenies, 3) calculate ED (Evolutionary Distinctiveness) values, and 4) calculate the correlations between the original and manipulated simulated phylogenies' ED values.
    
	The manipulations carried out on the simulated phylogenies include dropping tips randomly, dropping tips if some threshold of a simulated characteristic value is reached, and applying an imputation of a particular clade of specified size.
